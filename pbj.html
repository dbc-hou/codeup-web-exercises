<!-- MINI EXERCISE: Make a PB&J Recipe.

>>> Don't worry with the ingredient list just yet
>>> Place each recipe instruction inside a respective element (perhaps use <p> for each)
>>> Create a CSS class (here and in box-model: try not to inline your CSS props if not necessary) and give it a background color
>>> Use height/width defined in the above CSS class in order to format those elements
>>> Place your recipe instructions inside of a container.
>>> Define your container's box model so that it can display all of the instructions AND is centered left/right
        relative to its parent element (should be the body)
>>> Give the container enough top margin so to separate it from the top of the body element
